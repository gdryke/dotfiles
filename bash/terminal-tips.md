I need to setup a way to dump terminal tips, both on PS and bash.
can even do a profile/ENV on iterm2 to skip it, but usually require it to be clicked through.

Things like:
* `\ww` for a wiki in vim
* `ctrl + w -> v` for vertical window split (`:edit` for a new file)
* `cal` for a little calendar!
* `ls` options: `-A` for all but dots, `-F` to make dirs easier to see
* `cd -` for jumping back. Useful for bin dirs and stuff
* `sudo !!` rerun last command as root
